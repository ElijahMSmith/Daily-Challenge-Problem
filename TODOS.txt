Not currently updating configs when I re-rerun the dynos
Also resets to config base when we re-deploy

Is there a better solution here?


- Put a qualifier on similar problems for free or paid (requires a separate lookup)
- Preview of problem description? Either in thread or as part of the embed?
    - Add buttons to the embed to show/hide this information?
- Any way to get the information about companies that used the question?
