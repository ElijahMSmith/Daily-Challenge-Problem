A Discord bot that generates a daily LeetCode problem from each of the easy, medium, and hard category. Retrieves stats about the problem and organizes them into a Discord embed. Also creates a discussion thread for each problem.

You can add this bot to your server easily with the following link:
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=892977952927645736&permissions=34359757824&scope=bot

To receive daily problems, create a **text channel** that __contains__ (can be preceded or followed by anything) the phrase "daily-challenge-problem" - that's it!
